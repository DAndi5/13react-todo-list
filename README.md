## ⚙️ Advancement
The demo app is a static site, a basic single-page-app that has a few
addressable pages that are lazy loaded on-demand. It demonstrates basic CRUD
operations: 1) list todo, 2) view todo details, 3) create/edit and 4)
delete a todo.

The demo uses browser localStorage for the data storage, which means it runs
without a backend.
